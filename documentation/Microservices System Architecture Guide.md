Microservices System Architecture Guide
=======================================

Welcome to our Microservices System Architecture Guide! This document outlines best practices and key considerations for building a robust, scalable, and efficient system using NestJS, Angular, and MongoDB. Whether you're a new developer on the team or looking to understand our architecture, this guide will provide you with valuable insights.

Overview
--------

Our system utilizes a microservices architecture, with each service designed to handle a specific task. The backend services are built using NestJS, while the frontend services are developed using Angular. MongoDB serves as the database for all our services, ensuring seamless data management and performance.

Best Practices
--------------

### 1\. **Microservices Design**

*   Ensure each microservice is loosely coupled and adheres to a single responsibility principle.
*   Define clear APIs and contracts between services to facilitate effective communication.

### 2\. **Data Management**

*   Design your data schema to suit the needs of each service.
*   Avoid database sharing across services to maintain service independence.

### 3\. **API Gateway**

*   Implement an API Gateway to manage requests, perform load balancing, handle authentication, and route to appropriate services.

### 4\. **Authentication and Security**

*   Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure session management and API protection.
*   Implement best security practices to protect data and services.

### 5\. **Error Handling and Logging**

*   Establish a centralized logging mechanism for error tracking and system monitoring across services.

### 6\. **Development Environment**

*   Utilize Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration to streamline development and deployment processes.

### 7\. **Testing**

*   Develop a comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

### 8\. **Documentation**

*   Maintain detailed documentation for each service, especially API documentation, to support development and onboarding.

### 9\. **Performance**

*   Monitor and optimize MongoDB performance, particularly with large data volumes and complex operations.
*   Implement caching strategies where necessary to enhance performance.

### 10\. **Service Communication**

*   Choose the appropriate communication protocol (HTTP, gRPC, etc.) based on the specific needs of your system.
*   For real-time functionalities, consider using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE).

Conclusion
----------

By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to build a system that is not only functional and scalable but also manageable and secure. This guide should serve as a foundation for developing and maintaining high-quality services within our architecture. Thank you for contributing to our project's success!
